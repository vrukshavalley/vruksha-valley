1. How to Set Up the Development Environment

If you or a developer need to make changes to the code, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js: Download and install the latest LTS version from `nodejs.org`.
2. Open in VS Code: Open this folder in Visual Studio Code.
3. Install Dependencies: Open the terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl + ~`) and type:
`npm install`
(This restores the 'node_modules' folder using the package.json "shopping list")
4. Run Local Preview: Type the following command to see the site on your computer:
`npm run dev`
(View at: http://localhost:3000)

2. How to Update Content

* Rooms/Cottages: To update images or descriptions, go to `app/page.tsx` and find the `cottages` array.
* Journal (Blogs): To edit or add blog posts, go to `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` and update the `blogData` object. Ensure the `slug` in the list matches the URL.
* Booking Link: To change from WhatsApp to a booking engine like StayFlexi, update the `whatsappUrl` variable in `components/Navbar.tsx` and `app/about/page.tsx`.

3. Image Standards

To maintain the high-end look of the site, use these standards for new photos:

* Format: WebP
* Room/Grid Photos: 2400px x 3000px (4:5 Vertical Aspect Ratio)
* Hero/Cover Photos: 2560px x 1440px (16:9 Landscape)
* Tool: Use `Squoosh.app` to compress images to ~500KB before uploading.

4. Deployment & SEO

* Deployment: The site is configured to deploy automatically when changes are pushed to the GitHub repository.
* Search Engine Discovery: The `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` are configured for Google and AI discovery. Submit the sitemap to Google Search Console whenever a new blog is added.
